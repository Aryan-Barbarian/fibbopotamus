# Fibonacci Fun

This just plays around with three different algorithms for finding fibonacci numbers. Because it's mostly pure python, you can have insanely huge numbers.

## Requirements
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install these with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/) or you can just download [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) and have all of them.

## Usage
If you want to see the nth fib number, type:

`python main.py n`

If you want to profile the different method's performance up to the nth fib number, type:

`python main.py profile n`
